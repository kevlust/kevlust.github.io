# Assignment 1: Your Portfolio

# I believe that most things have been correctly implemented. I followed the
# guidelines, my files pass the HTML/CSS validator tests, and my pages follow
# the required formats.
# I do, however, have an issue with one of my fonts. The id I created, called
# "robotic" should give one of my headers a robotic look by changing the font,
# which does not seem to be working for all computers.

# I showed my assignment to a few friends (Ben Nissan, Alexis Galantino), who
# gave me feedback about the look (colors, font) of my page.

# I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
